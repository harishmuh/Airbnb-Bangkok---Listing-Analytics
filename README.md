# **Business Understanding**

## **Context**

Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service that allows people to rent out their properties or spare rooms to guests. 
Founded in 2007 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk in San Francisco, Airbnb has grown into one of the world's largest accommodation-sharing platforms. 
It operates through a website and mobile app, connecting hosts and travelers from around the globe. Guests can browse through various listings, ranging from entire homes and apartments to unique accommodations like treehouses and castles. 
Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to list their properties, set their own prices, and communicate with guests. It has transformed the way people travel by offering more personalized and unique lodging options compared to traditional hotels

## **Problem statement**

Post COVID-19 era, global tourism is recovering and bouncing back. Thailand secured its place among the top ten fastest-growing countries on Airbnbâ€™s accommodation searches for stays during Q1 in 2024. 
Among the top Thai destinations like Phuket, Pattaya, etc, Bangkok was the most booked on Airbnb. Furthermore, Bangkok ranked fifth in Airbnb's list of top trending global travel spots in 2023.

**Challenges and Opportunities for New Airbnb Partners**

While this influx of tourism is positive as more opportunities are coming, the new Bangkok listing providers will face some challenges. They lack crucial knowledge about established customer preferences, local competition trends, and optimal pricing strategies. 
Without this information, formulating effective business strategies and standing out in a competitive environment becomes difficult. To address these challenges and empower new Bangkok Airbnb partners, data analysis plays a critical role. 
By leveraging Airbnb's historical listing data, we can provide valuable insights and recommendations. This will equip them with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions regarding factors such as:

* **Listing pattern and optimization**: Understanding the current local competition in their neighborhood and identifying popular property types.
* **Pricing strategies**: Understanding local pricing trends and competitor analysis to set competitive yet profitable rates.
* **Guest communication**: Highlighting effective listing promotional language and descriptions that resonate with guests in Bangkok.

## **Goal: Guiding New Partner of AirBnB for Success** 

Through this data analysis project, we aim to answer the following question: 

**What are the key recommendations that can be provided to new listing providers embarking on their journey as Airbnb partners in Bangkok?**

By providing key recommendations, we can empower new partners to make well-informed business decisions and optimize their listings. This, in turn, will contribute to a thriving Airbnb ecosystem in Bangkok and foster a mutually beneficial long-term relationship between Airbnb and its partners.

## **Insights and Key Recommendations**
* **Listing Distribution**: There are some neighborhoods in Bangkok that have a high density of listings and have high listing competition. The locations of neighborhoods with a high density of listings are mostly near the center of Bangkok or near the tourist attraction. Interstingly, some neighborhoods that have the highest price of listing (Orange color) and generate the highest number of reviews, are also located in the center of Bangkok, near the tourist attraction. This indicates that location has a role in affecting price and number of reviews.

* The new listing providers need to be aware of the intensity of listing competition in their neighborhoods. In highly competitive locations, the new listing providers as the new entrants need to find their own additional uniqueness (based on amenities or probably add more services) that can be promoted in the listing description and use it as a competitive advantage to attract customers.
If the new listing providers have resources, consider organizing the listing into entire homes/apt as this room type has the highest number of reviews.

* The new listing providers need to consider registering their listing in the price category of premium as this category has the highest number of reviews in recent and all times.

* Considering to use of English for listing promotional instructions as this has a tendency to aim for higher prices and generate more reviews. However, the listing provider can also use non-English language instructions (such as Thai and Mandarin), if they want to attract a specific language user or target niche market.

* In formulating a listing description, consider highlighting the nearby major attraction and access as a selling point (e.g., Sukhumvit, BTS, walk, near), providing an accurate description of room type and listing facilities (e.g., room, condo, studio, apartment, bed, house), and adding the element of comfort (e.g., Cozy, private, luxury)
