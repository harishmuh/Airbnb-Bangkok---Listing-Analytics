**Business Understanding**

Context

Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service that allows people to rent out their properties or spare rooms to guests. 
Founded in 2007 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk in San Francisco, Airbnb has grown into one of the world's largest accommodation-sharing platforms. 
It operates through a website and mobile app, connecting hosts and travelers from around the globe. Guests can browse through various listings, ranging from entire homes and apartments to unique accommodations like treehouses and castles. 
Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to list their properties, set their own prices, and communicate with guests. It has transformed the way people travel by offering more personalized and unique lodging options compared to traditional hotels

Problem statement
Post COVID-19 era, global tourism is recovering and bouncing back. Thailand securing its place between the top ten of fastest-growing countries on Airbnbâ€™s accommodation searches for stays during Q1 in 2024. 
Among the top Thai destinations like Phuket, Pattaya etc, Bangkok was the most-booked on Airbnb. Furthermore, Bangkok ranked fifth in the Airbnb's list of top trending global travel spots in 2023.

Challenges and Opportunities for New Airbnb Partners

While this influx of tourism is positive as more opportunities are coming, the new Bangkok listing providers will face some challenges. They lack crucial knowledge about established customer preferences, local competition trends, and optimal pricing strategies. 
Without this information, formulating effective business strategies and standing out in a competitive environment becomes difficult. To address these challenges and empower new Bangkok Airbnb partners, data analysis plays a critical role. 
By leveraging Airbnb's historical listing data, we can provide valuable insights and recommendations. This will equip them with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions regarding factors such as:

-Listing pattern and optimization: Understanding the current local competition in their neighbourhood and identifying popular property types.
-Pricing strategies: Understanding local pricing trends and competitor analysis to set competitive yet profitable rates.
-Guest communication: Highlighting effective listing promotional language and descriptions that resonate with guests in Bangkok.

**Goal:** 

Through this data analysis project, we aim to answer the following question: **What are the key recommendations that can be provided to new listing providers embarking on their journey as Airbnb partners in Bangkok?**

By providing key recommendations, we can empower new partners to make well-informed business decisions and optimize their listings. This, in turn, will contribute to a thriving Airbnb ecosystem in Bangkok and foster a mutually beneficial long-term relationship between Airbnb and its partners.
